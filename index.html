                        <p>Born in 1935 <strong> Mercedes Sosa </strong> was an Argentine singer                           inmensely popular throughout Latin America. With her roots in argentine                           folk music, she became one of the preeminent exponents of Nuevo       Cancionero (new song). That's a musical tradition that combined folk rhythms with politically
                            charged lyrics about nonviolence and the plight of the poor and disenfranchised. Sosa is greatly
                            admired for the depth and beauty of her contralto voice. She gave voice to songs written by many
                            Latin American songwriters.</p>
                        <p> Mercedes Sosa's songs about the pain of exile, the fear of political violence, and the struggle for
                            justice inspire millions of Latin Americans who know that Sosa has lived her words.</p>
                        <p> In 1967, Sosa toured with great success the United States and Europe. In subsequent years, she performed
                            and recorded extensively, broadening her repertoire to include material from throughout Latin
                            America.</p>
                        <p>Sosa soon became the leading figure of the Nuevo Cancionero movement and her voice and guitar could
                            be heard throughout Latin America. But when a military junta took over Argentina in 1976, Sosa's
                            albums were banned and she and her concert goers were harassed. Finally, Sosa fled to exile in
                            Europe. She returned to Argentina in the early 1980s warmly welcomed by her fans. </p>
                        <p> In the following years, Sosa continued to tour both in Argentina and abroad, performing in such venues
                            as the Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and the Mogador in París. Sosa's repertoire continued to
                            broaden, and she made recordings in various styles.</p>
                        <p> She won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album in 2000 ("Misa Criolla"), 2003 ("Acústico") and
                            2006 ("Corazón Libre"), as well as many international awards.Her album Cantora 1 won two awards
                            at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2009. She won Best Folk Album and was nominated for Album of the
                            Year. The album was also awarded Best Recording Package. She died from multiple organ failure
                            in 2009. </p>
